### Q19: What is React Fiber?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **Definition:** Complete rewrite of React's reconciliation algorithm (React 16+)
- **Purpose:** Enable incremental rendering
- **What it is:** A data structure representing a unit of work
- **Goal:** Make rendering interruptible and prioritizable
- **Result:** Smoother UI, better perceived performance

**Fiber is:**
```
A "fiber" = A JavaScript object representing:
  - A component instance
  - Its current state
  - Its work to be done
  - Its relationship to other fibers
```

**The Problem Fiber Solved:**
```
Before Fiber (React 15):
  - Rendering was synchronous and blocking
  - Long updates froze the UI
  - No way to pause/resume work
  - No prioritization of updates
```

**After Fiber (React 16+):**
```
✅ Rendering can be paused and resumed
✅ Work can be split into chunks
✅ Updates can be prioritized
✅ Smooth animations even during heavy updates
```

### Q20: What is the main goal of React Fiber?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**Primary Goals:**

#### 1. **Incremental Rendering**
```
Break rendering work into chunks
Pause work to let browser handle urgent tasks (animations, user input)
Resume work later
```

#### 2. **Ability to Pause, Abort, or Reuse Work**
```javascript
// Example scenario:
User typing (high priority) → Pause current render
Handle keystroke immediately
Resume previous render when idle
```

#### 3. **Assign Priority to Different Types of Updates**
```
High Priority: User input, animations
Medium Priority: Data fetching
Low Priority: Analytics, logging
```

#### 4. **Time-Slicing**
```
Spread rendering work across multiple frames
Keep UI responsive
60 FPS target
```

**The Core Philosophy:**
```
"Rendering should not block the main thread"
```

**Benefits:**
- Smoother user experience
- Better perceived performance
- Can handle large component trees
- Enables Concurrent Features (Suspense, useTransition)

### Q230: What is concurrent rendering?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**Definition:**
- React can work on multiple renders simultaneously
- Can interrupt rendering to handle more urgent tasks
- Can prepare UI updates in memory before committing

**Key Concept: Concurrent ≠ Parallel**
```
Parallel: Multiple tasks running at the exact same time (requires multiple cores)
Concurrent: Multiple tasks in progress, but only one executing at a time (time-slicing)
```

**How Concurrent Rendering Works:**
```
1. Start rendering update A (low priority)
2. User clicks button (high priority)
3. Pause update A
4. Render update B (button click)
5. Commit update B to DOM
6. Resume update A
7. Commit update A to DOM
```

**Visual Timeline:**
```
Time →
[====A====]           [====A====]     Without concurrent
[==A==][B][==A==]                     With concurrent (B interrupts A)
```

**Concurrent Features Enabled:**
- **Suspense:** Show fallback while loading
- **useTransition:** Mark updates as non-urgent
- **useDeferredValue:** Defer expensive computations
- **Automatic batching:** Batch all updates

**Real-World Example:**
```javascript
// Heavy computation happening
function SearchResults() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

  // UI stays responsive while searching
  // User can keep typing without lag
  return <Results query={deferredQuery} />;
}
```

### Q231: Difference between async mode and concurrent mode?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**History Lesson:**

| Term | Timeline | Status | Meaning |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Async Mode** | 2018 (experimental) | Deprecated | Early name for concurrent features |
| **Concurrent Mode** | 2019-2021 (experimental) | Replaced | All-or-nothing concurrent rendering |
| **Concurrent Features** | 2022+ (React 18) | Current | Opt-in concurrent features |

**Why the Name Changed:**

**Async Mode** (2018):
```javascript
// Experimental - all or nothing
ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(<App />);
```
- Implied everything was async
- Confused developers
- Too vague

**Concurrent Mode** (2019-2021):
```javascript
// Still all or nothing
ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(<App />);
```
- Better name
- But forced entire app to be concurrent
- Breaking changes for some apps

**Concurrent Features** (React 18 - Current):
```javascript
// Opt-in per feature
import { useTransition, useDeferredValue, Suspense } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  // Only this update is concurrent
  startTransition(() => {
    setSearchQuery(input);
  });
}
```
- **Opt-in:** Choose which updates are concurrent
- **Gradual adoption:** Works with existing code
- **Backwards compatible:** Non-breaking

**Key Difference:**
```
Async/Concurrent Mode: Entire app uses concurrent rendering
Concurrent Features: Opt-in per update/component
```

### Q252: How does React update the screen in an application?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**The Two-Phase Process:**

#### Phase 1: Render Phase (Can be interrupted)
```
1. Component re-renders due to state/props change
2. React calls your component function
3. Creates new Virtual DOM tree
4. Runs diffing algorithm
5. Identifies what changed
```

#### Phase 2: Commit Phase (Cannot be interrupted)
```
6. Apply changes to real DOM
7. Run useLayoutEffect hooks
8. Browser paints screen
9. Run useEffect hooks
```

**Visual Flow:**
```
State Change
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│   RENDER PHASE      │ ← Can pause here (Fiber)
│ - Call components   │
│ - Build VDOM        │
│ - Calculate diff    │
└─────────────────────┘
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│   COMMIT PHASE      │ ← Cannot pause (must be sync)
│ - Update real DOM   │
│ - Run effects       │
└─────────────────────┘
    ↓
Browser Paints
```

**In React 18 with Concurrent Features:**
```javascript
// 1. State changes
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(1);

// 2. React schedules update
// 3. RENDER PHASE (interruptible):
//    - React calls component functions
//    - Builds new fiber tree
//    - Diffs with old tree
//    - Can pause if higher priority work comes in

// 4. COMMIT PHASE (synchronous):
//    - Updates DOM all at once
//    - Runs layout effects
//
// 5. Browser paints

// 6. Effects run (after paint)
```

**Key Insight:**
```
Render Phase: "What should the UI look like?"  (Interruptible)
Commit Phase: "Make it happen!"                (Must be fast & sync)
```

### Q253: How does React batch multiple state updates?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**Batching Definition:**
```
Multiple setState calls → Single re-render
Improves performance by reducing re-renders
```

**React 17 and Earlier (Limited Batching):**
```javascript
// ✅ Batched (inside event handlers)
function handleClick() {
  setCount(c => c + 1);    //
  setFlag(f => !f);        // } Single re-render
  setName('John');         //
}

// ❌ NOT batched (in promises, setTimeout, async)
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);    // Re-render 1
  setFlag(f => !f);        // Re-render 2
  setName('John');         // Re-render 3
}, 1000);

fetch('/api').then(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);    // Re-render 1
  setFlag(f => !f);        // Re-render 2
});
```

**React 18 (Automatic Batching Everywhere):**
```javascript
// ✅ ALL batched automatically
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);    //
  setFlag(f => !f);        // } Single re-render
  setName('John');         //
}, 1000);

fetch('/api').then(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);    //
  setFlag(f => !f);        // } Single re-render
});

// ✅ Even in native event handlers
element.addEventListener('click', () => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);    //
  setFlag(f => !f);        // } Single re-render
});
```

**How Batching Works:**
```
1. State update scheduled
2. React marks component as "needs update"
3. Waits for more updates (batching window)
4. Collects all updates
5. Re-renders once with all changes
```

**Visual:**
```
Without Batching:
setA(1) → Render → Paint
setB(2) → Render → Paint
setC(3) → Render → Paint
Total: 3 renders

With Batching:
setA(1) ┐
setB(2) ├→ Collect → Render → Paint
setC(3) ┘
Total: 1 render
```

**Benefits:**
- Fewer re-renders
- Better performance
- Prevents "half-finished" UI states

---

### Q254: Is it possible to prevent automatic batching?

**Your Answer:**
```
[Write your answer here]
```

**Yes! Use `flushSync` (but rarely needed)**

**Syntax:**
```javascript
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

function handleClick() {
  flushSync(() => {
    setCounter(c => c + 1);
  }); // DOM updated here

  // Read from DOM with updated value
  console.log(ref.current.textContent); // Shows new count

  setFlag(f => !f); // Separate render
}
```

**When You Might Need It:**

#### 1. **Measuring DOM Before Next Update**
```javascript
function Component() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const listRef = useRef();

  function addItem() {
    flushSync(() => {
      setItems([...items, newItem]);
    });

    // DOM is updated, can measure now
    const height = listRef.current.scrollHeight;
    scrollToBottom(height);
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Third-Party Library Integration**
```javascript
function Chart() {
  function updateData() {
    flushSync(() => {
      setData(newData);
    });

    // Chart library needs DOM to be updated
    chartLibrary.refresh();
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Focus Management**
```javascript
function Form() {
  function addField() {
    flushSync(() => {
      setFields([...fields, newField]);
    });

    // New field is in DOM, can focus it
    newFieldRef.current.focus();
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Warning:**
```javascript
// DON'T do this!
function handleClick() {
  flushSync(() => setCount(1));  // Render
  flushSync(() => setName('a')); // Render
  flushSync(() => setFlag(true)); // Render
  // Total: 3 renders (defeats batching!)
}

// DO this instead:
function handleClick() {
  setCount(1);    //
  setName('a');   // } Batched → 1 render
  setFlag(true);  //
}
```

**Key Point:**
```
Automatic batching is almost always what you want.
Only use flushSync when you NEED to read from DOM
between updates.
```

## 💡 Key Insights

**The Big Idea:**
```
Fiber = Making React rendering interruptible

Before: Start render → Must finish → UI frozen
After:  Start render → Pause for urgent work → Resume → Smooth UI
```

**For Senior Interviews - Emphasize:**
1. **Trade-offs:** Complexity vs smoothness
2. **When to use:** Concurrent features are opt-in
3. **Real impact:** Better UX for complex apps
4. **Migration:** Mostly backwards compatible
